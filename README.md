## Summary
My name is Aleksandr, and I am an engineer and technology enthusiast currently based in Berlin. My passion is to build products and make people’s lives easier using technology.

In my professional career lasting more than 15 years, I’ve been acting in various roles.

As an engineering manager, I focus on building autonomous teams that deliver impactful features in rapid iterations. In those teams, I facilitate building healthy engineering culture and fostering the personal success of the team members. I also work on building the team’s roadmap, ensuring alignment with initiatives’ stakeholders, and managing cross-team dependencies. I work on several public open-source and pet projects to stay up to date with technology.

I am interested in engineering leadership roles in modern and growing companies that develop innovative products with a modern toolchain.
